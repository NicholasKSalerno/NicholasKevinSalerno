    <h2>1. Flint, Michigan Lead Service Line Risk</h2>
    <img src="Maps/Layout.jpg" alt="Flint Lead Risk Map">
    <p>
      This map addresses the Flint, Michigan water crisis by identifying areas at higher risk of lead exposure through aging service lines. Buffer analysis was used to assess proximity of schools and populations to known or suspected lead pipes. This approach helps prioritize neighborhoods for infrastructure replacement and public health outreach.

      This map set explores population and housing data in Northern Miami. By comparing tract-level and block-level data, it highlights how scale influences spatial understanding. Areas with high population density and high vacancy rates are identified to inform urban planning and resource allocation.

    <p> This map shows the final candidiate areas for healthy food store developments in Philadelphia. </p>
    
    <p>
    <p>
      This project identifies optimal locations in Philadelphia for a new healthy food store. Areas were selected based on proximity to transit, inclusion in Empowerment Zones, and distance from existing food resources. A final candidate zone in West Philadelphia emerged as the top recommendation based on accessibility and unmet demand.
